""""
We start by initializing an empty set called unique, which allows O(1) lookup time because sets use hashing. 
Then, we iterate through each element in the list nums, referring to each element as num. 
For every num, we check if it already exists in our unique set: 
    If it does, that means we’ve found a duplicate, so we immediately return True. 
    If it doesn’t, we add num to the unique set and continue. 
    If we finish iterating through the entire list without finding any duplicates, we return False.
